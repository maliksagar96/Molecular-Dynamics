Kick start MD codes, easy and well structured.

These are the final codes for 2 very basic MD simulations. 
One of them being a Lennard Jones fluid. This simulation has 600 particles in a 15x15x15 box and acting potential is a shifted Lennard Jones potential.

The other one being a simple bead Spring Model with excluded volume applied. 

All the codes are well structed. All the results are present in their respective folders.
